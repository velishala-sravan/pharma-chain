# Steps to Push Changes to a Git Repository

This guide outlines the typical workflow for committing and pushing your changes to a remote Git repository.

1.  **Stage your changes:**
    Add the files you want to commit to the staging area.
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    (This command stages all changes in the current directory and its subdirectories. You can also stage specific files, e.g., `git add README.md`.)

2.  **Commit your changes:**
    Record your staged changes to the repository with a descriptive commit message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
    ```
    (Replace "Your descriptive commit message here" with a brief, clear summary of your changes.)

3.  **Add a remote repository (if not already added):**
    If you haven't already linked your local repository to a remote one, you'll need to add it.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
    ```
    (Replace `<remote_repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub, GitLab, or other remote repository.)

4.  **Push your changes:**
    Send your committed changes to the remote repository. The `-u` flag sets the upstream branch, so you can just use `git push` in the future.
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
    (Assuming your main branch is named `main`. If it's `master`, use `git push -u origin master`.)
